“As we will see, the contemporary science of consciousness distinguishes a minimum of three concepts: vigilance - the state of wakefulness, which varies when we fall asleep or wake up; attention - the focusing of our mental resources onto a specific piece of information; and conscious access - the fact that some of the attended information eventually enters our awareness and becomes reportable to others.”

The three stages above, explain to us scientifically how information is processed by humans. This distinguishes us from many other organisms on this planet, because we are expressive and responsive. This is an un-replicable trait. 

Not only so, we are flexible in reasoning, and the book explains this through phenomenal awareness. The ability to have a vantage point, an opinion, and even character. 

However, in light of the fascination towards this unique ability, the author also reminds us that we cannot process two images at the same time. One always come into focus as another blurs. This is not the incompetence of our visual sense, but consciousness playing a role. In the lengthy process of the three stages, information is constantly lost and not many makes it to the last stage of conscious access. 

One question I am excited to explore, after a piece of information arrives at the conscious access, is whether if it is human fault that an information returns to the subconsciousness, and eventually becomes forgotten?
