*Oxford Book of Short Stories*

*Poetry 180*

One of the first statements in the introduction that I felt in total agreement of, is  that “the number of poetry reads is about the same as the number of people who write poetry”. While poetry is a rising culture, there is also a diminishing audience. This leads to my second point, poetry has been condemned by teenagers to be “boring”. 

Their usual desires to accelerate contradicts with poetry’s message, often to reflect on the pace of life. If there is no room in poetry for difficulty, where is the difficulty to go? Just as poetry provides a home for ambiguity, it offers difficulty a place to be dramatised if not solved. John Ciardi asserts that we demand difficulty even in games. Due to modern poetry, difficulty became a criterion for appraising poetic value. Therefore, to students who are inexperienced to differentiate legitimate difficulty and obscurity, they could hardly understand the opacity of poetic discussions. 

The last argument I realised, is poets use their work as a method of direct emotional release. Clarity is to open yourself to judgement. Therefore, some poems may also be wilfully obscure to prevent appraisal or commentary. In such case, the interrogation of poetry may also become a very tedious affair for teachers and students. 

On the other hand, many poems which I have selected from this book, features either subjects of family or observation. This tells me, in introspection and as a teenager, our tense and significant relationship with our family; our desires to find interest beyond the classroom, and without the emotional attachment generally found in poetry.
