This was the first session that I participated in, and it most significant in reminding me the difficulty of online research. Referring to my previous experiences, the foremost problems in research include:
1) Not highlighting/recording key points, or key thoughts when comprehending research.
2) Retrieving specific data with clear sourcing.
Therefore, this activity that addressed online research, was able to hone our search engine skills and to introduce us to databases that filtered for accuracy. 

*Getting Published*

Oliver>Self Publishing

Despite the session being not to my expectations of actual publishing, the Librarian provided resources to the methods of local publishing. She demonstrated the perks and downfalls of the individual methods, and pointed out the current trend amongst amateur authors. 

There are platforms for publishing including: Google Books, Kindle Books and iBook Store. On the other hand, there are online sites which have a substantial audience, including Wattpad, DeviantArt and other fan fiction sites. In addition, there are writing competitions, which you are published when achieving an award.

The most useful information to me, are the local printing press who print books at an economic price. This includes an environmental printing press - Green Pagoda, the famous Fotomax, and e-print. Green Pagoda is the singular printing press that does hardcover books.

At first, I was fairly confident in my sourcing skills and the rules related to sourcing. However, beginning the presentation, I realised the maximum utility of Easybib and some tips I failed to notice before. 

The important parts that I noted down are the following:
1) Quotations should be used sparingly (never more than about 10% of a paper), and must be identical to the original.  Use a small segment (a larger portion is very seldom needed).  Quotes should really only be used if the piece written is so good, that rewording it would lose it’s power/meaning/etc.  
2) Utilise the notebook feature of Easybib. The notes can then can “grouped” into separate branches with respective headings/descriptions. With the natural organization of grouped notes, use the “outline” function to create the essay. The outline of the essay can be linked with the notes and printed for reference.
3) Easybib has an in-text citation function, which the user can customise the details. The availability of details can also differentiate depending on the type of the source (e.g. book or website). Moreover, the details can change on the information provided (or the lack of it), similar sources can also have methods to differentiate them. 

*HK and Chinese Questions*

Technically, this session did not commence due to an unscheduled Year 6 transition class, however Ms Lai created a google spreadsheet, where we could ask some questions. Personally, this prompted me to various questions, first and foremost is our stereotype of culture. The first thought is materialistic culture and despite being afraid to challenge its importance, other than the related aspects of identity, we are unable to think of more. 

However, when we actually begin to research about this term, we realise how broad it is, and how closely related culture is with civilisation. More so, culture is more linked towards civilisation, than to the ethnicity that we usually think of. But, we must take a step back, it is not without reason that we commonly think of culture to be related with ethnicity. Perhaps according to Freud, civilisation does reach a peak, or maybe Globalisation has brought such a large change that we cannot respond to, yet it has lead us to a heightened awareness of our deteriorating heritage.

Our recognition of culture has, of course, enriched our lives with the fascination of cognitive shock and the spur of patriotic passion. However, it also makes us wonder the purpose of culture, as it is closely related to its importance. Is its purpose to give coherence to our modern progress; to provide a backbone to societal interaction; to serve as an indicator of racial harmony; or a utility for further economic development? Maybe, culture concerns simply the continuation of a legacy, with no relevance whether heritage is /completely/ intact?

*Creative Writing*

In this session, Mr Morgan delivered a short and concise presentation about various tips about writing. During the presentation, I was surprised by the truth of what Mr Morgan was saying and by his experience in this field. 
There are several point that rang true especially, which was:

1) Conflict is the soul of a story
2) Writing is a reflection of an author’s observation/introspection
3) That despite the author is in complete dictation of his imagination, he/she themselves, cannot restrain the flexibility of their thought.
4) Writing concerns progress and growth of both author and story, rather than the product or outcome.
5) That there must be a complexity, and it can originate in randomness.

*Psychology Questions*

The most important topic of my discussion with Ms Telfer, is about individualistic and collectivist cultures. One of the biggest influences in our life is our society, which is determined by our culture. Ms Telfer carefully pointed out that most psychological studies are done in individualistic (western) cultures, and it may suggest a lack of correlation in our local community, especially with our experiences of reading “Catcher in the Rye”. 

However, speaking from personal experience, most students in our school simultaneously dislikes Chinese novels. This is due to the distinctive features of suffering and sacrifice, values embedded in the traditional Chinese culture. 

Therefore, referencing Erikson’s stages of Psychosocial Development, in our teenage years we do attempt to try different identities, including cultural identities. However, perhaps both arguments for collectivist cultures and individualistic cultures are incomplete to respond to my inquiries. This first prompts me to research more into epistemology. 

But the last question is, given that our society is becoming more globalised and multicultural, does it suggest a positive or negative influence in the combination of traits? Are there any traits that have emerged from the process of transition?
