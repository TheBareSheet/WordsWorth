**Interviews**

*Cherry Wu*

Cherry recommended self-publishing given her experience with various denials, given that it is a student’s work. Moreover, she mentioned even publishing under a company, would require a lot of additional fees, which may not be affordable in the duration of the personal project. However, she used the following website to actually print out the copies of her book.

*Tiffany Yu*

Despite turning to a family friend for printing, Tiffany shared a few tips about the designing of a book, in order to be able to print. She assured that the printing press will inform the author about the book dimensions and margins, therefore there will be no issues of scaling; the printing press will also arrange for you. Also, she had to go to the book registration office in Hong Kong to retrieve an ISBN for her book. There was no specific license as it is just intellectual property, but it was also not the Creative Common’s license. Lastly, she suggested to find publishing companies that fit the genre of the book.

We are moved by fictitious works not because of the characters themselves; not only because we construct empathetic relations with the characters, but principally because in the process of interpretation, we project our knowledge and experiences onto the analogues in the works. We are moved by our interpretations of the essence of the works - not the works themselves.
