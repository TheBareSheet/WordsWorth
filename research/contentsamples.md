*Einstein’s Dreams*

*Notes from Underground*

There was two themes of the book that was most memorable and significant to my personal project. 

Firstly, by using the whole authentic story to work against the rational egoism of the modern era, it makes a more so convincing statement that we have sought only but control in our lives. Perhaps the more ‘civilised’ the society becomes, we are then becoming more withdrawn in our confusion, resulting alienation of conventions. It is a conflicting generation we have to live in, when our education and research propels us to greater knowledge, while media culture and traditional institutions impose a conventional approach. 

Secondly, it directs attention towards our obsession at inertia. This raises the matter of consciousness, where it thoroughly demonstrates the concept of the perceived and perceiving. Consciousness in this case is highly separate from the act itself, the main character of the story struggles constantly through the debate of self (the perceiving criticising the inert perceived). However, this proves the very being of our judgement and vision, except for our inability to realise it. 

The above relates to one of the questions I try to answer in this personal project. Not all students echo the thoughts of traditional coming of age books, such as Catcher in the Rye. Therefore, is this about a difference in thought (paragraph 1), or the simple perception of our world?

*Boyhood*

The film Boyhood, with the depiction of their authentic growth is what distinguishes from the many other coming of age stories. Whether it is strictly scripted, the audience is able to visually and emotionally feel the changing attitude of the teenage boy. 

While the backstory of a divorce (and the continuous abuse of step-dads) may be overreaching a standard family, the main character expresses his troubles much less spontaneously, and more subtly through events. This is a striking contrast to another coming of age book Looking for Alaska, which features a “manic pixie dream girl”, a very two dimensional character. 

More importantly, in the moments of sentiment, Mason (the main character) said “moments see us, and not the way around”. He used to strive for freedom, but his mother cried when he was about to leave for college. His mother too sought the freedom away from the tormentors of her family, and when she finally settled, found the home that she could call for her children, she was lost. Things were not a mess, just something she didn’t know. To me, this is the consequence of our obsession with free will. We forget why we want it for and moments, what is most important, will strike us. There is sometimes no need to specified intentions, and if we try so much, sometimes we won’t even see the moment. 

Therefore, this brings us to the question, whether our decisions is about the choice itself or why we had that idea in the first place?
