**Beginnings of Infinity**


*Identity cannot be described, the same way we cannot describe a noun.*

When we speak of identity, it is often that we begin thinking of distinguishing characteristics of a particular entity. We think of how others perceive us. We think of our responsibilities and social expectations that binds us to the service of our community.

It becomes tiresome, a tedious affair to introduce yourself, without sounding too arrogant or shy. It turns uncomfortable and much too formal for your taste. And perhaps, it nurtures the urge to be unconventional. Sometimes the person you’re introducing, doesn’t sound like yourself anymore.

The Greek motto “Know Thyself” encourages us to understand ourselves. And how often do we think of ourselves truly, except for the times we are self-conscious in a public place? Why do we persist on defining characteristics, when identity is a continuity. There is no problem in admitting that we seem the same, within the regeneration of our consciousness. 

<u>Identity is neither pre-defined by our actions nor our perceptions of it.</u>

In the rise of economic development, we can say that we have become more “cultured”. We have the resources, allowing the cultivation of innovation and expression (in an integrative manner). As we continue to discover and actualise the many factors that makes life “better”, “happier”, it becomes a matter of choice.

One can say, there is no problem in finding conflict in change, being naturally compelled and confined by it. Thus, rational egoists like us, would see to that we maximise our available options. But our freewill seems to induce, more often the case, a desire for possession. Speak to the other voice in your mind, which I’m sure we all have: is it a greater relief to reach a utilitarian decision, or is it the feeling of control and the pleasure in unorthodox ideas? It is certainly more exciting to gamble into the unknown, the same way we tend to shy away from the possibility of destiny. 

But, “I know nothing”, Famous Greek philosopher Socrates once said. When facing more and more daunting feelings, is it more important to make a decision or to understand why? In the example of double standards, should we care about the nature of the inequality or the concerns that motivate the decision? 

<u>How do we ask?</u>

While the actions that define our identity are in most contradiction, we are restricted to only step back, into the complexity of our enigma. However, infinity is reality, its perpetual flux and movement. The problem, is our attempt to find and resolve a non-existent one. The solution, portrayed in many forms, appearing in different times, is the flexibility in accommodating the unknown.
